This is exemplary project of E2E tests written in Cypress + TypeScript, using Page Object pattern. Application under test is a Medium.com colne (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/#/)) 

Frontend and backend was done by [TonyMckes](https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app) with my little modifications.

### Capability test charters
Before writing any E2E tests, I documented the various capabilities of the application that I plan to cover with tests.

- [Home page](./test-charters/home-page.md)
- [Settings]
